hitting_set_approximation.py :
approximates the hitting set for a series of strictly increasing input lists.

Implements the following: 
Given k sorted, strictly increasing lists of integers, find the smallest set of values that contains at least one integer from each list. For example, given the lists [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 4, 6, 8], and [3, 6, 9, 12], possible solutions are [2, 3], [2, 6], [2, 9], [3, 8], etc.

Example usage: python3 hitting_set_approximation.py test_input_large.txt
